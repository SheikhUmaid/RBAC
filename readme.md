Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
Project Overview
The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System is a Django-based API project that facilitates secure and role-specific access to files. Users can manage files and assign roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer) to other users with varying levels of access permissions. The system integrates JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions and implements robust error handling, logging, and unit testing for critical endpoints.

Features
Authentication:

User registration, login, logout, and token refresh using JWT.
Secure API endpoints with role-specific permissions.
Throttling for anonymous users to prevent brute force attacks.
File Management:

CRUD operations on files.
Assign editors and viewers with controlled access.
Role-Based Permissions:

Owner: Full access to the file (create, read, update, delete).
Editor: Read and edit access to the file.
Viewer: Read-only access to the file.
Advanced Querying:

Retrieve files based on ownership, edit, or view permissions.
Pagination:

API responses support pagination for scalable data retrieval.
Logging and Validation:

Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing.
Validation for user input at every step.
Soft Delete:

Files are marked as deleted instead of being permanently removed.
